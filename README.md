# GeoMiner

GeoMiner is an API that is designed to provide an interface layer between the Gowalla API and geosocial mobile games.  The code in this repository is currently a [Gaelyk](http://gaelyk.appspot.com/) application that runs in Google's [App Engine](http://appengine.google.com/).

## Gowalla Goes to Facebook

With Gowalla shutting down their doors (something I was not aware of, but thanks to the [Pro Android Web Apps Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pro-android-web-apps) I became aware of), I am currently investigating integrating either the Foursquare API or potentially Facebook places to take the place of Gowalla.

## A potential transition to Node.js and CouchDB

Most of my day to day work now is using Node.js and CouchDB, so rather than maintain this groovy application it would probably better to migrate this to a node + couch application.  I am currently investigating this an will post an update here soon regarding my decision.
